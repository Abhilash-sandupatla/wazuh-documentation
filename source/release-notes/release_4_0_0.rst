4.0.0 Release notes
===================

This section lists the changes in version 4.0.0. More details about these changes are provided in the changelog of each component:

- `wazuh/wazuh <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/blob/4.0/CHANGELOG.md>`_
- `wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/blob/4.0-7.9/CHANGELOG.md>`_
- `wazuh/ruleset <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-ruleset/blob/4.0/CHANGELOG.md>`_
- `wazuh/wazuh-packages <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-packages/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_

Highlights
----------

- The agent enrollment is now performed on the main daemon initialization. There is no need to request a key using an external CLI anymore. Agents are now able to request a key to the manager on their own if no key was defined on startup or if the manager has rejected the connection (Agents in ``3.x`` version are still 100% compatible with ``4.x`` version). 

- Wazuh API RBAC: Configure users, roles, and policies to manage access permissions. Wazuh WUI now permits granular control over access to resources depending on user roles, this will allow enterprises to manage user accounts that fulfill different functions in the security of the environment.

- Wazuh API is now embedded in the Wazuh manager.

- Wazuh manager and agents will use TCP as the default communication protocol.

- The Windows agent MSI installer is now signed using DigiCert instead of GlobalSign. DigiCert is known for being present on more Windows versions including the oldest ones.

- FIM implements now a set of settings to control the module temporal files disk usage. This means that now we can choose the amount of disk space used by the report change utility. The diff option reports changes in the monitored files, to do so, it creates a compressed copy of the file and checks if it changes. This method may use a lot of disk space. Wazuh 4.0 introduces new capabilities to limit the space used.


Breaking changes
----------------

- The agent-auth tool starts the deprecation cycle (to be deprecated in v5.0.0). The agent registration on demand will still be available using CLI.

- The API is now embedded in the Wazuh manager, no wazuh-api package will be installed anymore.

- Wazuh manager and agents are no longer using UDP as the default communication protocol. TCP is enabled by default.

- OpenSCAP policies removed from RPM and DEB packages. Folder present policies in the agent installation will be removed.
