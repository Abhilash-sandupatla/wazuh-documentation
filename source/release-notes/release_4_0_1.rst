Wazuh core
----------

Changed
^^^^^^^

**Framework**

- Updated Python cryptography library to version ``3.2.1``.

Fixed
^^^^^

**API**

- Added missing ``agent:group`` resource to the RBAC catalog. This prevented the Wazuh Kibana plugin from obtaining the correct information from the RBAC catalog.
- Changed ``limit`` parameter behavior in ``GET sca/{agent_id}/checks/{policy_id}`` endpoint and fixed some information loss when paginating ``wdb``.
- Fixed an error with ``GET /security/users/me`` when logged in with ``run_as``. This endpoint must return the permissions and information of the user who makes the request. However, when the user was authenticated through ``auth_context``, this endpoint did not return the permissions granted by this method.

**Framework**

- Fixed zip files compression and handling in cluster integrity synchronization.

**Core**

- Fixed version matching when assigning a feed in the Vulnerability Detector.
- Prevented unprivileged users from accessing the Wazuh Agent folder in Windows.
- Fixed a bug that may lead the agent to crash when reading an invalid Logcollector configuration.

Wazuh Kibana plugin
-------------------

Added
^^^^^

- Support for Wazuh v4.0.1.

Fixed
^^^^^

- Fixed icons that did not align correctly in ``Modules > Events``.
- Fixed statistics visualizations that did not show data.
- Fixed error on loading CSS files.
- Fixed search filter in the search bar in ``Module/SCA`` that was not working.

Wazuh ruleset
-------------

Fixed
^^^^^

- Removed duplicated Windows rules for ``EventChannel``.  These extra rules were preventing certain events from triggering alerts.
