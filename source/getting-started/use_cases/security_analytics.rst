Security analytics
==================

Wazuh provides users with a complete set of security analytics tools to be used when working with logs and alerts generated by file changes or registry keys. Wazuh analyzes security events and improves the detection of attacks in real time.

Its :ref:`agent modular architecture <wazuh_agent>` allows Wazuh to collect security data from different components. This way, Wazuh generates alerts and events, fetching data from the endpoints where the agents are installed. 

Below you can see a list of these components:

- **File integrity monitoring (FIM)** reports when files are created, deleted, or modified in the monitored directories. 
- **Malware detection** looks for hidden processes, files, and ports to detect anomalies and the possible presence of rootkits. 
- **Command execution** can be used to achieve different purposes such as to monitor hard disk space left and get a list of last logged-in users. 
- **Log collector** reads flat log files, collecting operating system and application log messages.
- **System inventory** runs regular scans, collecting inventory data including network interfaces, operating system version, installed applications, running processes, and a list of open ports. 
- **Security configuration assessment (SCA)** provides a continuous evaluation based on the Center of Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks.

Security analytics tools give users the visibility needed to perform thread prevention actions. The :ref:`FIM <file_integrity>` module is a good example because it detects changes that could compromise data and creates alerts based on them. Then, the agent can be configured to trigger an Active Response in reply to these alerts.

In addition, these tools assist users in detecting the possible presence of rootkits and collecting inventory data from different sources such as operating systems, processes, applications, ports, and network interfaces. FIM results can be observed in :ref:`Wazuh Kibana plugin<kibana_app>` in the *Overview > Integrity monitoring* section:
