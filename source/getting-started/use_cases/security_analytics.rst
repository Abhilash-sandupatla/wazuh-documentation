Security analytics
==================

Wazuh stands out, delivering users a complete set of security analytics tools when working with logs and alerts generated by changes in files or registry keys. By deploying these, Wazuh analyzes security events and improves the detection of attacks in real time.

Its agent modular architecture allows Wazuh to collect security data from different components. This way, Wazuh generates alerts and events, fetching data from the endpoints where the agents are installed. 

Below you can see a list of these components:

- **File integrity monitoring (FIM)** reports when files are created, deleted, or modified in the monitored directories. 
- **Malware detection** looks for hidden processes, files, and ports to detect anomalies and the possible presence of rootkits. 
- **Command execution** can be used to achieve different purposes such as monitoring hard disk space left, getting a list of last logged-in users, etc. 
- **Log collector** reads flat log files, collecting operating system and application log messages.
- **System inventory** runs regular scans, collecting inventory data including network interfaces, operating system version, installed applications, running processes, and a list of open ports. 
- **Security configuration assessment (SCA)** provides configuration assessment based on the Center of Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks.

Security Analytics tools help users perform thread prevention actions such as collecting operating systems and application log messages. Users can also get a list of last logged-in users, monitor the file system, and report when files are created, deleted, or modified.

In addition, these tools assist users in monitoring space left in multiple hard disks, detecting the possible presence of rootkits; and collect inventory data such as operating system version, network interfaces, running processes, installed applications, and a list of open ports.
