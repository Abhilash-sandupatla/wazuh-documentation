Use cases
=========

The Wazuh platform is used to protect and monitor systems in different ways. Because of all of its capabilities, it is widely used for threat prevention, detection, and response. Besides, the Wazuh platform is used to meet regulatory compliance requirements, such as PCI DSS or HIPAA, and configuration standards like CIS hardening guides.

Wazuh is a popular security solution among users of IaaS (Amazon AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) to monitor virtual machines and cloud instances. This is done at a system level utilizing the :ref:`Wazuh security agent <wazuh_agent>`, and at an infrastructure level pulling data directly from the cloud provider API.

Additionally, Wazuh is often employed to protect containerized environments providing cloud-native runtime security. This feature is based on an integration with the Docker engine API and Kubernetes API. Moreover, for better protection, the Wazuh security agent can run on the Docker host providing a complete set of threat detection and response capabilities.

Bellow you can find examples of some of the most common use cases of the Wazuh solution.
