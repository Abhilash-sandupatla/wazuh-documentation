Wazuh indexer
=============

Wazuh indexer is a highly scalable, full-text search and analytics engine. This Wazuh central component indexes and stores alerts generated by the Wazuh server and provides near real-time data search and analytics capabilities. Wazuh indexer can be configured as a single-node or multi-node cluster, providing scalability and high availability. 

Wazuh indexer stores data as JSON documents. Each document correlates a set of keys, field names or properties, with their corresponding values which can be strings, numbers, Booleans, dates, arrays of values, geolocations, or other types of data.

An index is a collection of documents that are related to each other. The documents stored in Wazuh indexer are distributed across different containers known as shards. By distributing the documents across multiple shards, and distributing those shards across multiple nodes, Wazuh indexer can ensure redundancy. This protects your system against hardware failures and increases query capacity as nodes are added to a cluster.

The Wazuh indexer uses a data structure called inverted index, which is designed to allow quick full-text searches. An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all the documents that contain each particular word. During the indexing process, Wazuh indexer stores documents and builds an inverted index to make the document data searchable in near real-time. Indexing is initiated with the Wazuh indexer API, through which you can add or update a JSON document in a specific index.

Wazuh uses four different indices to store different event types.

| **wazuh** |--| **alerts**       | Stores alerts generated by the :ref:`Wazuh server <wazuh_server>`. These are created each time an event trips a rule with a high enough priority (this threshold is configurable).                                             |
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
| **wazuh** |--| **archives**     | Stores all events (archive data) received by the analysis engine, whether or not they trip a rule.                                                                                                                             |
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
| **wazuh** |--| **monitoring**   | Stores data related to the :ref:`Wazuh agents <wazuh_agent>` status over time. It is used by the web interface to represent when individual agents are or have been ``Active``, ``Disconnected``, or ``Never connected``.      |
+---------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
| **wazuh** |--| **statistics**   | Stores data related to the Wazuh manager performance. It is used by the web interface to represent the daemons' statistics.                                                                                                    |

The Wazuh indexer is well suited for time-sensitive use cases like security analytics and infrastructure monitoring as it is a near real-time search platform. The latency from the time a document is indexed until it becomes searchable is very short â€” typically one second.

You interact with the Wazuh indexer clusters using the Wazuh indexer REST API, which offers a lot of flexibility. You can perform searches, add or delete documents, modify indices, and more. In addition to its speed, scalability, and resiliency, Wazuh indexer has several powerful built-in features that make storing and searching data even more efficient, such as data rollups, alerting, anomaly detection, and index lifecycle management.
