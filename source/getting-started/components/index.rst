Components
==========

The Wazuh platform provides features to protect your cloud, container, and server workloads. These include log data analysis, intrusion and malware detection, file integrity monitoring, configuration assessment, vulnerability detection, and support for regulatory compliance. The Wazuh solution is based on the Wazuh agent, which is deployed on the monitored endpoints, and on three central components in charge of analyzing, processing, and storing the data: the Wazuh server, the Elasticsearch, and the Kibana.

- :ref:`Wazuh agent <wazuh_agent>`: Installed on endpoints such as laptops, desktops, servers, cloud instances or virtual machines, it provides prevention, detection, and response capabilities. It also supports several operating systems such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Solaris, AIX, and HP-UX.
- :ref:`Wazuh server <wazuh_server>`: It analyzes data received from the agents, processing it through decoders and rules, and using threat intelligence to look for well-known indicators of compromise (IOCs). A single server can analyze data from hundreds or thousands of agents, and scale horizontally when set up as a cluster. This central component is also used to manage the agents, configuring and upgrading them remotely when necessary.
- :ref:`Elasticsearch <wazuh_indexer>`: This is a highly scalable, full-text search and analytics engine. This central component indexes and stores alerts generated by the Wazuh server. 
- :ref:`Kibana <wazuh_dashboard>`: It is a powerful user interface for data visualization and analysis. It is also used to manage Wazuh configuration and to monitor its status.

In addition to agent-based monitoring capabilities, the Wazuh platform can monitor agent-less devices such as firewalls, switches, routers, or network IDS, among others. For example, a system log data can be collected via Syslog, and its configuration can be monitored through periodic probing of its data, for example, via SSH or through an API.
