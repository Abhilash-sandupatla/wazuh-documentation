Vulnerability detection
=======================

Wazuh helps users gain visibility into the endpoints within their environment using the Vulnerability Detector module. The module lets users discover vulnerabilities in the operating system and applications installed on the monitored endpoints. This audit functions using Wazuhâ€™s native integration with external vulnerability feeds indexed by Canonical, Debian, Red Hat, Arch Linux, Amazon Linux Advisories Security (ALAS), Microsoft, and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
