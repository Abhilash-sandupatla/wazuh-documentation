   :description: Wazuh vulnerability detector has three different scan types. Learn more about it in this section of the documentation.

Scan types
==========

Wazuh has three different types of scans.

-  **Baseline**: The Vulnerability Detector triggers this scan type the first time you enable the module. The Vulnerability Detector performs a full scan of the operating system and every package installed. It creates a CVE inventory and generates an alert for each vulnerability.

-  **Full scan**: The vulnerability detector scans every installed package and operating system in this scan type. It runs only when the configured ``min_full_scan_interval`` expires and when the CVEs database contains new information. As a result, Wazuh generates alerts when there is any update/change in the vulnerability inventory.

-  **Partial scan**: The vulnerability detector only scans new packages. As a result, Wazuh generates alerts when there is any update/change in the CVE inventory.
