Wazuh role-based access control
===============================

Wazuh RBAC allows access to Wazuh resources based on the roles and policies assigned to the users. It is an easy-to-use administration system that permits to manage users or entitiesâ€™ permissions to the different resources of the system in a simple way. The users will be able to execute only the functions over which they have permissions. 

Learn how to create internal users and map them with Wazuh in the below sections.

Use case: Give a user permissions to manage an agents group
-----------------------------------------------------------

In this use case, we have an environment with five agents and we want to create a user with permissions to manage an agent group. Agents **001**, **002**, and **005** belong to the ``Team_A`` group whereas agents **003**, **004**, and **005** belong to the ``Team_B`` group. To learn more on how to create agents groups see :ref:`Grouping agents <grouping-agents>`.

To prepare the environment, add a label in the ``Team_A`` centralized configuration ``agent.conf``. To learn more, see :ref:`Agent labels <labels>`. 

  .. code-block:: console

      <agent_config>
      	<labels>
