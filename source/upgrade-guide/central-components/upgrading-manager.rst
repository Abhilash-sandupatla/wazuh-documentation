Wazuh manager
=============

Upgrade the Wazuh manager to the latest available version. When upgrading a multi-node Wazuh manager cluster, it is recommended to run the upgrade in the master node first to reduce server downtime.

.. note::
   
   Root user privileges are required to execute all the commands described below.

Upgrade the Wazuh manager
-------------------------

#. Add the Wazuh repository. You can skip this step if the repository is already present and enabled on the node. 

   .. tabs::


     .. group-tab:: Yum


       .. include:: /_templates/installations/common/yum/add-repository.rst



     .. group-tab:: APT


       .. include:: /_templates/installations/common/deb/add-repository.rst




#. Upgrade the Wazuh manager to the latest version.

   .. note::

      If the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` configuration file has been modified, it will not be replaced by the upgrade. You must therefore add the settings of the new capabilities manually. More information can be found in :doc:`/user-manual/index`.

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: Yum

         .. code-block:: console

            # yum upgrade wazuh-manager

      .. group-tab:: APT

         .. code-block:: console

            # apt-get install wazuh-manager

   .. note::

      If upgrading a multi-node Wazuh manager cluster, it is necessary to run the upgrade in every node. Otherwise, Wazuh manager nodes will not join the cluster.

#. **Recommended action** - Disable the Wazuh repository when finished upgrading the Wazuh components in the node to prevent accidental upgrades.
  
   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: Yum

         .. code-block:: console

            # sed -i "s/^enabled=1/enabled=0/" /etc/yum.repos.d/wazuh.repo

      .. group-tab:: APT

         .. code-block:: console

            # sed -i "s/^deb/#deb/" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazuh.list
            # apt-get update

         Alternatively, you can set the package state to ``hold``. This will stop automatic upgrades but it will still be possible to upgrade it manually using ``apt-get install``.

         .. code-block:: console

            # echo "wazuh-manager hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections

            
#. Repeat these steps for every Wazuh manager node.
