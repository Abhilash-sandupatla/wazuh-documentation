Cloud service
=============
  
Wazuh Cloud hosts and manages all the Wazuh components in one integrated platform, allowing you to capitalize on the Wazuh capabilities and features. It provides cloud-delivered protection with *Security Information and Event Management* (SIEM) and *Endpoint Detection and Response* (EDR).

The cloud solution offers scalability with its flexible infrastructure. You can tailor the cloud solution to meet specific needs and upgrade it to the most appropriate tier. 

Also, data in single-tenant cloud environments is completely isolated. That means that your account is the only one with access to the Wazuh components of the environment, providing another layer of security.

The setting up of a Wazuh Cloud environment is streamlined. Installing the Wazuh components, defining scalability, and updating the solution is all handled by Wazuh.
We provide a free trial for you to create a cloud environment and access the Wazuh solution and its capabilities.
