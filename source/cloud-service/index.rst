Cloud service
=============
  
Wazuh Cloud hosts and manages all the Wazuh components in one integrated platform. You can create and tailor your Cloud environment to meet specific needs and upgrade it to the most appropriate tier. The setting up of a Wazuh Cloud environment is streamlined: installing and updating the Wazuh components, and defining scalability is all handled by Wazuh Cloud.

Wazuh protects your enterprise with *Security Information and Event Management* (SIEM) and *Endpoint Detection and Response* (EDR), and Wazuh Cloud single-tennancy isolates your data, providing another layer of security.
