Concepts
--------

**Cloud Console**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provides web-based access to manage your Wazuh Cloud environments.

.. _cloud_glossary_cloud_id:

**Cloud ID**
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Cloud ID is a unique ID to your environment on Wazuh Cloud. It is used for multiple purposes such as Wazuh WUI access or agent registration process.

.. _cloud_glossary_cold_storage:

**Cold Storage**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data containing the output generated by Wazuh such as alerts or archives, and a daily configuration backup. This data will be uploaded within 10 to 30 minutes since it was processed by Wazuh. Then, it will be :ref:`available to be downloaded<cloud_your_environment_accessing_cold_storage>` through the Wazuh Cloud API by the user. There is no size limit for this data, but alerts and archives will be removed 365 days after their creation, and so will backup files after 30 days.

.. _cloud_glossary_environment:

**Environment**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An environment contains all the Wazuh components ready to use and running on Wazuh Cloud.

.. _cloud_glossary_hot_storage:

**Hot Storage**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data available on the Wazuh WUI corresponding to the information indexed by Wazuh. This information is available as soon as Wazuh ingests the events sent by the agents and index them, making it searchable and analyzable.

More precisely, this storage is calculated using the primary shards of ``wazuh-*`` indices.

.. _cloud_glossary_region:

**Region**
^^^^^^^^^^

A region is the geographic area where the data center of the cloud provider that hosts your environment is located. The region you select cannot be changed after you create an environment. If you are not sure what to pick, choose a region that is geographically close to you to reduce latency.

The list of available regions is: US (N. Virginia, Ohio), Europe (London, Frankfurt) or Asia Pacific (Singapore).


**RESTful API**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A RESTful API to interact with Wazuh Cloud. E.g. it can be used to access an environment's cold storage.

.. _cloud_glossary_tier:

**Tier**
^^^^^^^^

The tier is the size limitation, in bytes, of the hot storage. When the tier is reached, the oldest events disappear from your index. Events removed from your index are still available in cold storage. This `estimation tool <https://wazuh.com/cloud/#pricing>`_ may help you to select your tier.
