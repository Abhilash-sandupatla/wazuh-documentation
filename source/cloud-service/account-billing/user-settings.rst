Each Wazuh Cloud account has a primary email associated with it. If needed, you can change this primary email address:

3. Click on **Email address**.
4. Enter a new email address and your current password.
5. An email is sent to the new address with a link to confirm the change.

Change your password
--------------------

When you signed up for a Wazuh Cloud account with your email address, you selected a password that you use to log in to the console. If needed, you can change this password.

If you know your current password:

1. Log in to the Wazuh Cloud Console.
2. Go to User settings.
3. In **Change password**, enter the current password and provide the new password that you want to use.

If you donâ€™t know your current password:

1. At the login screen for the Wazuh Cloud Console, click the link **Forgot password?**.
2. Enter the primary email address for your account and click **Reset password**.
3. An email is sent to the address you specified with a link to reset the password.

Enable multi-factor authentication
----------------------------------

To add an extra layer of security to your Wazuh Cloud account, you can set up a Virtual MFA Device like Google authenticator.

To enable multi-factor authentication:

1. Log in to the Wazuh Cloud Console.
2. Go to User settings
3. In Multi-factor authentication, click on **Add MFA** and follow the described steps.
4. If your device is lost or stolen, contact support.

Change your login method
------------------------

There are two types of login: Google Sign-In or password-based login.

- If you signed up for a Wazuh Cloud account using the password-based login, you can still log in with your Google account. Go to the Login page and click **Log in with Google**. Both login methods will be available.
- In case you signed up with Google, it is not possible to switch to password-based login.
