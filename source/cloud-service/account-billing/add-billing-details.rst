In order to use an environment beyond the trial period, you need to add a credit card to your account. Your credit card information is sent securely to our billing provider and stored with them.

.. note::

  A trial environment is converted to a paid environment when the trial expires. If you don't add your credit card before the expiration date, your environment will be deleted. Make sure to add your credit card before the end of the trial period.

To add the billing details:

1. Log in to the Wazuh Cloud Console.

2. Go to **Account**.

3. Select **Billing**.

4. In Payment method, select **Add billing information**.

5. Fill the form with your billing details.

6. Save the payment method.

If you want, you can stop new charges by canceling your environments.
