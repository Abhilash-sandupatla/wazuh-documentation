Wazuh provides a free trial for you to create a cloud environment and access the Wazuh solution and its capabilities.

Follow the next steps to create your trial environment.

Sign up
-------

To sign up, all you need is an email address:

1. Go to our `Wazuh Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.wazuh.com/>`_ page.
2. Enter your email address and password, or sign up with a Google account.

You are ready to create your first :ref:`environment <cloud_glossary_environment>`.

Create environment
------------------

Follow these steps to quickly set up and run your environment:

1. From the `Wazuh Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.wazuh.com/>`_, click **Start your free trial**.

2. Configure your environment:

   1. Give your environment a name.

   2. Choose a :ref:`tier <cloud_glossary_tier>` to define the size in bytes of the indexed events. You can use this `estimation tool <https://wazuh.com/cloud/#pricing>`_ to calcultate the Wazuh Cloud data tier.
   
   .. note:: During the 14-day trial period, the tier limit is of 100GB. Then, after your first payment, the full tier becomes unlocked. If all you want to do is try out Wazuh, the trial includes more than enough to get you started.

   3. Select the :ref:`region <cloud_glossary_region>` where your environment gets hosted. If you are not sure what to pick, select one that is the closest to your location since this typically reduces latency for indexing and search requests.

   4. Choose the support plan that best suits your needs. 

3. Click **View the summary** and then click **Create** to build your environment. This process might take a moment.

Once the environment is ready, you can access the Wazuh WUI and register the agents.
