  :description: Learn how to get started with Wazuh Cloud Service

Using Wazuh Cloud is the easiest way to take advantage of all the power that Wazuh offers. 

An environment contains all the Wazuh components ready to use in one place. Installing the Wazuh manager and the Elastic Stack, making decisions about scalability and high availability, or updating each component is no longer needed. Just connect your endpoints to the environment and we will set the rest up for you.

To get started with your first environment, sign up for a free trial. No credit card is required.
