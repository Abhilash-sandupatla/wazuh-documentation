What is Wazuh Cloud?
--------------------

Wazuh Cloud hosts and manages all the Wazuh components in one platform. Just connect your endpoints to the cloud environment and we will set the rest up for you. Wazuh is a solution for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR).

Can I try it for free?
----------------------

Yes, you can :ref:`sign up for a 14-day free trial<cloud_getting_started_sign_up>`. The trial starts the moment you create an environment. No credit card is required.


Will I be charged when my trial is over?
----------------------------------------

No. No credit card is required for your trial, so you will only be charged if you decide to keep using our service beyond the trial period.


Is it PCI DDS compliant?
------------------------

Yes. Our Wazuh Cloud platform has been validated as PCI DSS Level 1 Service Provider compliant.

What is a tier?
---------------

See :ref:`tier <cloud_glossary_tier>`.
