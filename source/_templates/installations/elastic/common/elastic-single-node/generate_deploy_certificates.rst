* Move to the installation location and create the certificates directory:

  .. code-block:: console

    # mkdir /etc/elasticsearch/certs
    # cd /etc/elasticsearch/certs

* Download the Search Guard offline TLS tool to create the certificates:

  .. code-block:: console

    # curl -so ~/search-guard-tlstool-1.8.zip https://maven.search-guard.com/search-guard-tlstool/1.8/search-guard-tlstool-1.8.zip

* Extract the downloaded file. It is assumed that it has been downloaded in ``~/`` (home directory):

  .. code-block:: console

    # unzip ~/search-guard-tlstool-1.8.zip -d ~/searchguard

* Download the ``search-guard.yml`` configuration file. Choose either ``Wazuh single-node cluster`` if there is only one Wazuh server, or ``Wazuh multi-node cluster`` in case of having more than one Wazuh servers:

  .. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Wazuh single-node cluster

      .. code-block:: console

        # curl -so ~/searchguard/search-guard.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh-documentation/develop/resources/open-distro/searchguard/single-node/search-guard.yml


      After downloading the configuration file in ``~/searchguard/search-guard.yml``, replace the value ``<elasticsearch_IP>`` with the corresponding Elasticsearch's IP. More than one IP can be specified (one entry per line):

        .. code-block:: yaml

          nodes:
            - name: elasticsearch
            dn: CN=node-1,OU=Docu,O=Wazuh,L=California,C=US
            ip:
              - <elasticsearch_IP>

    .. group-tab:: Wazuh multi-node cluster

      .. code-block:: console

        # curl -so ~/searchguard/search-guard.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh-documentation/develop/resources/open-distro/searchguard/single-node/search-guard-multi-node.yml


      After downloading the configuration file, replace the value ``<elasticsearch_IP>`` with the corresponding Elasticsearch's IP in the file ``~/searchguard/search-guard.yml``. More than one IP can be specified (one entry per line):

        .. code-block:: yaml

          nodes:
            - name: elasticsearch
            dn: CN=node-1,OU=Docu,O=Wazuh,L=California,C=US
            ip:
              - <elasticsearch_IP>

      There should be as many ``filebeat-X`` sections as Wazuh servers in the installation:

        .. code-block:: yaml

          - name: filebeat-1
            dn: CN=filebeat-1,OU=Docu,O=Wazuh,L=California,C=US
          - name: filebeat-2
            dn: CN=filebeat-2,OU=Docu,O=Wazuh,L=California,C=US
 
  
  To learn more about how to create and configure the certificates visit the :ref:`Certificates deployment section <user_manual_certificates>`.

* Run the Search Guard's script to create the certificates:

  .. code-block:: console

    # ~/searchguard/tools/sgtlstool.sh -c ~/searchguard/search-guard.yml -ca -crt -t /etc/elasticsearch/certs/


  In case of further certificates deployments, it is highly recommended to keep Search Guard's TLS offline tool and its configuration file ``search-guard.yml`` on the master node.

* Compress all the necessary files to be sent to the all the instances:

  .. code-block:: console

    # tar -cf /etc/elasticsearch/certs/certs.tar *

* Copy ``certs.tar`` to all the servers of the distributed deployment. This can be done by using, for example, ``scp``. 

* Remove unnecessary files:

  .. code-block:: console

    # rm /etc/elasticsearch/certs/client-certificates.readme /etc/elasticsearch/certs/elasticsearch_elasticsearch_config_snippet.yml search-guard-tlstool-1.7.zip filebeat* -f

* If Kibana will be installed in this node, keep the certificates file. Otherwise, if the file has been already copied to all the instances of the distributed deployment, remove it to increase security  ``rm -f certs.tar``.
