Once Elasticsearch is installed, download the preconfigured configuration file:

.. code-block:: console

  # curl -so /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml https://packages.wazuh.com/resources/4.2/open-distro/elasticsearch/7.x/elasticsearch.yml

This file configures Elasticsearch to use ``0.0.0.0`` for the ``network.host`` variable, so it accepts communications directed to any of its IP addresses instead of binding to the IP of a specific network interface in the host. Access may be restricted to a specific network interface by specifying its IP in this setting so Elasticsearch is not unnecessarily exposed.
