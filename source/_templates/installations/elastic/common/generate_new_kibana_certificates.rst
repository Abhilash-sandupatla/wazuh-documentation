In case of installing Kibana on a separate host where Elasticsearch was installed, new certificates for Kibana should be created. This step must be done on the Elasticsearch initial node where the rest of the certificates were created:


* Modify the ``search-guard.yml`` file placed at ``/etc/elasticsearch/certs/searchguard`` and add the following information at the end of the ``clients`` section:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    - name: kibana
      dn: CN=kibana,OU=Docu,O=Wazuh,L=California,C=US

* Run the Search Guardâ€™s script to create the certificates:

  .. code-block:: console

    # /etc/elasticsearch/certs/searchguard/tools/sgtlstool.sh -c /etc/elasticsearch/certs/searchguard/search-guard.yml -crt -t /etc/elasticsearch/certs/

* Add the new certificates to the ``certs.tar`` compressed file:

  .. code-block:: console

    # tar -rvf certs.tar kibana.pem kibana.key

Once the certificates have been created, they can be removed from the Elasticsearch initial node and added to the ``certs.tar`` file, then it must be copied into the Kibana server, for example, using ``scp``. This guide assumes that the file is placed in ~/ (home user folder):

.. code-block:: console

  # mkdir /etc/kibana/certs
  # mv ~/certs.tar /etc/kibana/certs/
  # cd /etc/kibana/certs/
  # tar -xf certs.tar kibana.pem kibana.key root-ca.pem

.. End of include file
