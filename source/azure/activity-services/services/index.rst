Wazuh also allows to monitor services such as Azure Active Directory using the `Microsoft Graph REST API <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview>`_, which provides access to Azure AD through REST API endpoints. Applications can use the Microsoft Graph API to perform read operations on directory data and objects.
