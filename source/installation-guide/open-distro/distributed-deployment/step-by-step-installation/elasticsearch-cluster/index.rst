Elasticsearch cluster
=====================

The Elastic Stack can be installed as a single-node cluster or as a multi-node cluster. The single-node installation will be performed in only one host where Open Distro for Elasticsearch will be installed. The multi-node installation consists of the installation of several Elastic Stack nodes in different hosts that will communicate between them. This kind of installation provides high availability and load balancing.
