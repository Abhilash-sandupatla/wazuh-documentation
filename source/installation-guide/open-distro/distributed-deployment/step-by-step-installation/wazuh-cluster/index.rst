Wazuh cluster
=============

The Wazuh server can be installed as a single-node cluster or as a multi-node cluster. The single-node installation will be performed in only one host where the Wazuh manager, the Wazuh API, and Filebeat will be installed. The multi-node installation consists of the installation of several Wazuh server nodes in different hosts that will communicate between them. This kind of installation provides high availability and load balancing.
