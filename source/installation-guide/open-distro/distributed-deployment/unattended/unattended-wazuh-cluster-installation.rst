Wazuh server unattended installation
====================================

This section will explain how to install the Wazuh manager, the Wazuh API, and Filebeat-OSS using an automated script. This script will perform a health check to verify that the system has enough resources to ensure the proper performance of the installation. For more information, please visit the :ref:`requirements <installation_requirements>` section.

Run the script
--------------

.. note:: Root user privileges are required to run all the commands described below. To download the script the package ``curl`` will be used.


Download the script:

.. code-block:: console

    # curl -so ~/wazuh-server-installation.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh-documentation/2205-Open_Distro_installation/resources/open-distro/unattended-installation/distributed/wazuh-server-installation.sh 
    

Filebeat needs to be configured by adding the Elasticsearch nodes IPs in order to connect with them. Choose between single-node or multi-node depending on the type of installation. The following commands assume that the script has been downloaded in the root home directory ( ``~/`` ):

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Single-node

    .. code-block:: console

        # bash ~/wazuh-server-installation.sh -ip <elasticsearch_IP>

    Replace the ``<elasticsearch_IP>`` by the corresponding Elasticsearch IP.


  .. group-tab:: Multi-node

    .. code-block:: console

        # bash ~/wazuh-server-installation.sh -ip <elasticsearch_IP_1> -ip <elasticsearch_IP_2>

    Replace the ``<elasticsearch_IP_X>`` values by the corresponding Elasticsearch IPs. There must be added as many ``-ip`` tags as nodes needed.


The script allows the following options:

+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Options                       | Purpose                                                                                                       |
+===============================+===============================================================================================================+
| -ip / --elasticsearch-ip      | Indicates the IP of Elasticsearch. Can be added as many as necessary                                          |
+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -i / --ignore-healthcheck     | Ignores the health-check                                                                                      |
+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| -h / --help                   | Shows help                                                                                                    |

Configure the installation
--------------------------

After the installation of all the components of the node, some steps must be done manually. Choose between single-node or multi-node depending on the type of installation:

.. tabs::


  .. group-tab:: Single-node


    .. include:: ../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/copy_certificates_filebeat_un.rst



  .. group-tab:: Multi-node


    By default, the Wazuh manager is configured to work as a single-node cluster. The following steps will describe how to configure the Wazuh manager as a Wazuh ``master`` or ``worker`` node.

    **Master node:**

    #. .. include:: ../../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/common/configure_wazuh_master_node.rst


    #. Once the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` configuration file is edited, the Wazuh manager needs to be restarted:

    .. include:: ../../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/common/restart_wazuh_manager.rst


    **Worker node:**

    #. .. include:: ../../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/common/configure_wazuh_worker_node.rst


    #. Once the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` configuration file is edited, the Wazuh manager needs to be restarted:

        .. include:: ../../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/common/restart_wazuh_manager.rst

    #. .. include:: ../../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/common/check_wazuh_cluster.rst 


    **Certificates deployment**
    
    During the Elasticsearch installation, the ``certs.tar`` file was created.This guide assumes that a copy of this file has been placed in the root home folder (``~/``).

    The ``X`` must be replaced with the number used in the certificate name defined for this Wazuh server:

    .. code-block:: console

      # cd /etc/filebeat/certs/
      # tar -xf certs.tar filebeat-X.pem filebeat-X.key root-ca.pem
      # mv /etc/filebeat/certs/filebeat-X.pem /etc/filebeat/certs/filebeat.pem
      # mv /etc/filebeat/certs/filebeat-X.key /etc/filebeat/certs/filebeat.key



Enable and start the Filebeat service:

.. include:: ../../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/enable_filebeat.rst

To ensure that Filebeat has been successfully installed, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: console

        # filebeat test output

An example response should look as follows:

.. code-block:: none
            :class: output

            elasticsearch: https://<elasticsearch_IP>:9200...
