Install Wazuh with Open Distro for Elasticsearch, which is an Apache 2.0 licensed distribution of Elasticsearch enhanced with enterprise security, alerts, SQL support, automated index management, or deep performance analysis, among other features. To learn more about each component and its capabilities, check the :ref:`Components <components>` section.

Deployment types
----------------

There are two different options for deploying Wazuh:

- **All-in-one deployment**: Wazuh and Open Distro for Elasticsearch are installed on the same host. 

- **Distributed deployment**: Each component is installed on a separate host as a single-node or multi-node cluster. This type of deployment provides high availability and scalability of the product, and it is convenient for large working environments.
  
For information on the minimum hardware requirements for the different types of deployment, check the :ref:`Requirements <installation_requirements>` section. 


Installation methods
---------------------

For each type of deployment, the user can choose between two installation methods:

- **Unattended**: You can install Wazuh using scripts that automate the installation process. The scripts also perform health checks to verify that the available system resources meet the minimal requirements.

- **Step by step**: This is a manual way of carrying out the installation that includes a detailed description of each step of the process.
