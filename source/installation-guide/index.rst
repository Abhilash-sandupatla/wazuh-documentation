Wazuh installation guide
========================

This section aims to guide the user through the process of installing Wazuh and its multiple components. A brief explanation about each component and its capabilities can be found in the :ref:`getting started <components>` section. 

Install Wazuh server
--------------------

There are two different alternatives to deploy a Wazuh installation. Here is a brief explanation about each deployment type:

- :ref:`All-in-one <all_in_one_index>`: All the Wazuh components are installed in the same host, this type of deployment is suitable for testing and small working environments. If you want to test Wazuh, you can download our ready to use :ref:`OVA <virtual_machine>`.

- :ref:`Distributed <distributed_index>`: Each component is installed in a separate host as a single-node or multi-node cluster. This type of deployment allows the high availability and scalability of the product and is suitable for large working environments.

Install Wazuh agents
--------------------

The Wazuh Agent is a single, light-weight monitoring software that can be installed in the majority of Operating Systems providing visibility on the security of that endpoint by collecting critical system and application logs, inventory data and detecting possible anomalies. To install a Wazuh agent select your operating system and follow the installation steps:
