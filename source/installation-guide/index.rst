Installation guide
==================

**Version 2.0**

Wazuh is a free, open source and enterprise-ready security monitoring solution for threat detection, integrity monitoring, incident response, and regulatory compliance. 
The solution is widely used by thousands of organizations around the world, from small businesses to large enterprises as it offers scalability and high availability of the product. You can start using Wazuh as well by following the Wazuh installation guide which allows you to install and configure its central components as needed. Alternatively, you can check our :ref:`Quickstart <quickstart>` to learn how to run the unattended script which quickly installs and configures all the Wazuh central components on the same host.

The Wazuh central components include the Wazuh server, Elasticsearch, and Kibana. 

- The :ref:`Wazuh server <wazuh_server_installation>` analyzes the data received from the Wazuh agents, processing it through decoders and rules, and using threat intelligence to look for well-known indicators of compromise (IOCs). A single server can analyze data from hundreds or thousands of agents and triggers alerts when threats or anomalies are detected. This central component is also used to manage the agents, configuring and upgrading them remotely when necessary.

- :ref:`Elasticsearch <wazuh_indexer_installation>` is a highly scalable, full-text search and analytics engine. This component indexes and stores alerts generated by the Wazuh server and provides near real-time data search and analytics capabilities. Elasticsearch can be configured as a single-node or multi-node cluster as needed.

- :ref:`Kibana <wazuh_dashboard_installation>` is a flexible and intuitive web interface for mining, analyzing, and visualizing data. In combination with the Wazuh Kibana plugin, it is also used for the management and monitoring of the Wazuh infrastructure. It includes out-of-the-box dashboards to quickly visualize security events, detected vulnerable applications, file integrity monitoring data, configuration assessment results, cloud infrastructure monitoring events, and regulatory compliance, such as PCI DSS, GDPR, CIS, HIPAA, and NIST 800-53 standards.


Installing the Wazuh central components

You can install each component on the same server, one by one, or on different servers as a distributed deployment. The Wazuh server and Elasticsearch can each be installed as a single-node or multi-node cluster depending on the environment needs. Small Wazuh deployments, which do not require processing large amounts of data, can easily be handled by a single-node cluster. Multi-node clusters are recommended when there is a large number of monitored endpoints, when a large volume of data is anticipated, or when high availability is required.

The diagram below represents a Wazuh deployment architecture. It shows the solution components and how the Wazuh servers and Elasticsearch can be configured as a cluster, providing load balancing and high-availability.

.. note:: Wazuh also offers `Wazuh Cloud <https://wazuh.com/cloud/>`_, where all components are hosted on our PCI-DSS and SOC 2 Type 2 certified SaaS solution. With Wazuh cloud, no dedicated hardware is required, maintenance is done by the Wazuh team, and everything is ready to use. This service provides a highly flexible infrastructure to match your enterprise needs.

Wazuh can also be installed with commercial options like Elastic Stack basic license or Splunk. To learn more about these options and other installation alternatives, see the :ref:`More installation alternatives <more_installation_alternatives>` section.

Wazuh agent installation
------------------------

If the Wazuh central components are already installed on your environment, select your endpoint's operating system and follow the installation steps to deploy the :ref:`Wazuh agent <wazuh_agent>`. This is a single and lightweight monitoring software that runs on most operating systems and provides visibility into the endpoint's security by collecting critical system and application records, inventory data, and detecting potential anomalies.
