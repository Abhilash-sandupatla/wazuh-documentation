Deployment variables
====================

For an agent to be fully deployed and connected to the Wazuh server it needs to be installed, registered and configured. To make the process simple, the installers can use variables that allow the configuration provisioning.

Below you can find a table showing the different operating systems with which you can make an automatic deployment using these variables.
