Installing Wazuh indexer in step-by-step mode
=============================================

The Wazuh indexer is a highly scalable full-text search engine based on Open Distro for Elasticsearch. It offers advanced security, alerting, index management, deep performance analysis, and several other features.

.. note:: Root user privileges are necessary to run all the commands.

Wazuh indexer cluster installation and configuration
----------------------------------------------------

Install the Wazuh indexer in a single-node or multi-node configuration according to your environment needs. If you want to install a single-node cluster, follow the instructions to install the initial node and proceed directly to initialize the cluster. 

The installation process is divided in three stages.  

#. Initial node installation and configuration

#. Subsequent nodes installation and configuration for distributed deployments

#. Initializing the Elasticsearch cluster


1. Initial node configuration
-----------------------------

Install and configure the initial node. During this stage the SSL certificates to encrypt communications between the different Wazuh components are generated, these certificates are later deployed to other Wazuh instances. 

Adding the Wazuh repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  .. tabs::
  
  
    .. group-tab:: Yum
  
  
      .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/yum/add_repository_elastic_cluster.rst
  
  
  
    .. group-tab:: APT
  
  
      .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/deb/add_repository_elastic_cluster.rst
  
  
  
    .. group-tab:: ZYpp
  
  
      .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/zypp/add_repository_elastic_cluster.rst



Installing Elasticsearch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install Open Distro for Elasticsearch.

  .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/install_elastic.rst

Configuring Elasticsearch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure Elasticsearch successfully, follow these steps:

  .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/elastic-multi-node/configure_elasticsearch_initial.rst

Adding Elasticsearch roles and users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the Wazuh Kibana plugin properly, run the following command to add new users and roles in Kibana.

  .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/add_roles_and_users.rst

Creating and deploying certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Remove the demo certificates:

    .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/remove_demo_certs.rst

#. Generate and deploy the certificates:

    .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/elastic-multi-node/generate_certificates.rst

#. Enable and start the Elasticsearch service:

    .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/enable_elasticsearch.rst

.. note:: The Open Distro for Elasticsearch performance analyzer plugin is installed by default and can have a negative impact on system resources. We recommend removing it with the following command ``/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin remove opendistro-performance-analyzer``. Make sure to restart the Elasticsearch service afterwards. 
 
If you want to install a single-node cluster, proceed directly to :ref:`initialize the cluster <initialize_cluster>`. 

2. Subsequent nodes configuration
---------------------------------

The second stage of the process for installing a multi-node cluster is performed on the subsequent nodes of the Elasticsearch cluster. 

Adding the Wazuh repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    .. group-tab:: Yum
  
  
      .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/yum/add_repository_elastic_cluster.rst

      .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/wazuh/zypp/add_repository_elastic_cluster.rst



Installing Elasticsearch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install Open Distro for Elasticsearch:

  .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/install_elastic.rst


Configuring Elasticsearch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure Elasticsearch successfully, follow these steps:

.. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/elastic-multi-node/configure_elasticsearch_subsequent.rst


Deploying certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Remove the demo certificates:

    .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/remove_demo_certs.rst

#. Configure Elasticsearch certificates:

    .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/elastic-multi-node/deploy_certificates.rst

#. Enable and start the Elasticsearch service:

    .. include:: ../../../_templates/installations/elastic/common/enable_elasticsearch.rst

.. note:: The Open Distro for Elasticsearch performance analyzer plugin is installed by default and can have a negative impact on system resources. We recommend removing it with the following command ``/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin remove opendistro-performance-analyzer``. Make sure to restart the Elasticsearch service afterward. 

.. _initialize_cluster:

3. Initializing the cluster
---------------------------

The final stage of the process for installing a multi-node cluster is performed on the initial node and consists in running the security admin script. 

#. Run the Elasticsearch ``securityadmin`` script on the initial node to load the new certificates information and start the cluster. Replace ``<elasticsearch_IP>`` with the Elasticsearch installation IP and run the following command:

    .. code-block:: console

      # export JAVA_HOME=/usr/share/elasticsearch/jdk/ && /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins/opendistro_security/tools/securityadmin.sh -cd /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins/opendistro_security/securityconfig/ -icl -nhnv -cacert /etc/elasticsearch/certs/root-ca.pem -cert /etc/elasticsearch/certs/admin.pem -key /etc/elasticsearch/certs/admin-key.pem -h <elasticsearch_IP>

#. Replace ``<elasticsearch_IP>`` and run the following command to confirm that the installation is successful: 

    .. code-block:: console

      # curl -XGET https://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200 -u admin:admin -k

    An example response should look as follows:

    .. code-block:: none
        :class: output

        {
          "name" : "node-1",
          "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
          "cluster_uuid" : "tWYgqpgdRz6fGN8gH11flw",
          "version" : {
            "number" : "7.10.2",
            "build_flavor" : "oss",
            "build_type" : "rpm",
            "build_hash" : "747e1cc71def077253878a59143c1f785afa92b9",
            "build_date" : "2021-01-13T00:42:12.435326Z",
            "build_snapshot" : false,
            "lucene_version" : "8.7.0",
            "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
            "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
          },
          "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
        }
  



.. note:: It is highly recommended to change the default passwords of Elasticsearch for the usersâ€™ passwords. To perform this action, see the :ref:`Elasticsearch tuning <elastic_tuning>` section.


It is also recommended to customize the file ``/etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options`` in order to improve the performance of Elasticsearch. Learn more about these processes in the :ref:`user manual <elastic_tuning>`.



To uninstall Elasticsearch, visit the :ref:`Uninstalling section <uninstall_elasticsearch>`.
