  :description: Install and configure Wazuh, the open source security platform, in just a few minutes using the unattended installation script. 


Wazuh quickstart
================

Wazuh is a free, open source and enterprise-ready security monitoring solution for threat detection, integrity monitoring, incident response, and regulatory compliance. To learn more about the Wazuh solution, its components, architecture, and capabilities, check the :ref:`Getting started <getting_started>` section. 

With Wazuh quickstart, you install the Wazuh server, Elasticsearch and Kibana on the same host using the unattended installation script. These central components are in charge of analyzing the data gathered by the Wazuh agents, providing a search engine and data visualization tool that allow users to navigate through their security alerts.

By running the automated script, you install and configure the Wazuh in just a few minutes.

Alternatively, you can check our :ref:`Installation guide <installation_guide>` to learn how to install each component individually on the same server, as an all-in-one deployment, or on different servers as a distributed deployment depending on the environment needs.

Hardware requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Hardware
  
  +-------------------------+-------------------------------+
  |  Minimum                |   Recommended                 |
  +----------+--------------+--------------+----------------+

  +----------+--------------+--------------+----------------+

- Disk space

  The amount of data depends on the generated alerts per second (APS). This table details the estimated disk space needed per agent to store 90 days of alerts on a Wazuh server, depending on the type of monitored endpoints.

  +-------------------------------------------------+-----+---------------------------+
  | Monitored endpoints                             | APS | Storage                   |
  |                                                 |     |  (GB/90 days)             |
  +=================================================+=====+===========================+
  | Servers                                         | 0.25|           3.8             |
  +-------------------------------------------------+-----+---------------------------+
  | Workstations                                    | 0.1 |           1.5             |
  +-------------------------------------------------+-----+---------------------------+
  | Network devices                                 | 0.5 |           7.6             |
  +-------------------------------------------------+-----+---------------------------+

  For example, for an environment with 80 workstations, 10 servers, and 10 network devices, the storage needed for 90 days of alerts is 236 GB approximately.

      .
      Installation finished
      
      You can access the web interface https://<server_ip>. The credentials are wazuh:vhDpq7YcwA08BLTmcdeYeJmXPU_VD31f

   You now have installed and configured Wazuh. Access the web interface and start securing your systems with Wazuh.       

#. Access the Wazuh web interface with your credentials. 

    - URL: *https://<server_ip>*
    - **Username**: *wazuh*
    - **Password**: *<wazuh_password>*

  When you access Kibana for the first time, the browser shows a warning message stating that the certificate was not issued by a trusted authority. An exception can be added in the advanced options of the web browser or, for increased security, the ``root-ca.pem`` file previously generated can be imported to the certificate manager of the browser. Alternatively, a certificate from a trusted authority can be configured. 

If you want to uninstall the components of the all-in-one installation, run the unattended installation script and use the option ``-r / --uninstall``.  

Next steps
----------

The Wazuh environment is now ready and you can proceed with installing the Wazuh agent on the endpoints to be monitored.

The :ref:`Wazuh agent <wazuh_agent>` is a single and lightweight monitoring software that runs on most operating systems. It provides visibility into the endpoint's security by collecting critical system and application records, inventory data, and detecting potential anomalies. Now that your environment is ready, select the operating system of your endpoint and follow the installation steps to deploy the agent.
