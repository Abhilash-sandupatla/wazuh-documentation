Detecting a Shellshock attack
=============================

Wazuh is capable of detecting a Shellshock attack by analyzing web server logs collected from a monitored endpoint. In addition, the attack can also be identified at a network level by configuring a Suricata integration. 

Check the :ref:`Shellshock attack <learning_wazuh_shellshock>` section of our documentation for further information. Additionally, the :ref:`Catch suspicious network traffic <learning_wazuh_suricata>` section provides information on how to configure a Suricata integration.


Prerequisites
-------------

- You need an Apache server running on the monitored CentOS 8 system.

Configuration
-------------

#. Add the following lines to the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` configuration file at the Wazuh CentOS 8 host. This sets the Linux agent to monitor the access logs of your Apache server.

    .. code-block:: XML

        <localfile>
            <log_format>apache</log_format>
            <location>/var/log/httpd/access_log</location>
        </localfile>

    Optionally, you can install Suricata on the CentOS 8 endpoint and configure it to monitor the endpoint's network traffic.

#. Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the changes. 

    .. code-block:: console

        # systemctl restart wazuh-agent


Steps to generate the alerts
----------------------------

#. Replace ``<your_web_server_address>`` with the appropriate value and execute the following command from a system external to your CentOS 8 endpoint (the attacker).

    .. code-block:: console

        # curl -H "User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/cat /etc/passwd" <your_web_server_address>

Query the alerts
----------------

You can visualize the alert data in the Wazuh Kibana plugin. To do this, go to the **Security events** module and add the filters in the search bar to query the alerts.

- ``rule.description:"Shellshock"``

- If you have Suricata monitoring the endpoint's traffic, you can also query ``*suricata* AND rule.description: "Suricata: Alert - GPL WEB_SERVER 403 Forbidden"`` for the related Suricata's alerts.
